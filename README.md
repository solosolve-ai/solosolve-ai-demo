## üåü **Project Vision**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82da3298-4a29-444e-a45f-a74cc921a159)

To create a highly accurate, scalable, and continuously improving AI-powered customer complaint resolution system for Amazon Fashion. SoloSolver Pro will leverage multimodal inputs, deep contextual understanding through RAG, robust data engineering practices, and efficient, SOTA LLM fine-tuning and deployment techniques to provide fair, consistent, and empathetic customer support, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

---

## üöÄ **Core Features**

SoloSolver Pro is engineered with a multi-faceted approach to complaint resolution, moving beyond simple classification to a deep, contextual understanding of each case.

### **1. SOTA LLM-Powered Resolution Engine**
- **Fine-Tuned Gemma-3 Model:** Utilizes a `google/gemma-3-4b-it` model fine-tuned with QLoRA for state-of-the-art performance in generating structured, empathetic, and policy-aligned resolutions.
- **Multi-Task Learning:** The model simultaneously learns to generate a comprehensive JSON analysis, classify complaint drivers, determine severity, and predict sentiment, all from a single input.

### **2. Advanced RAG & Contextual Understanding**
- **Dynamic Policy Retrieval:** Implements a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using a semantic vector search (ChromaDB/Vertex AI) on a meticulously chunked Policy Database to ground every decision in company policy.
- **Dynamic User Profiling (UDP):** Generates and queries user-specific profiles on-the-fly, considering their historical interactions, purchase value, and past complaint patterns to provide personalized and fair resolutions.

### **3. Multimodal Complaint Analysis**
- **Conceptual Image Analysis:** Even without direct image processing in the initial phase, the model is prompted to infer the context of user-submitted images based on the complaint text, enabling a more holistic analysis of issues like "item arrived damaged."

### **4. Scalable Data Engineering Backbone**
- **Modern Data Stack:** Leverages Google Cloud Platform (GCS, BigQuery) and `dbt` for a scalable, version-controlled, and testable data pipeline, transforming raw review data into a "gold standard" transaction database.
- **Automated SFT Data Curation:** Employs stratified sampling and SQL UDFs within BigQuery to programmatically curate a high-quality, balanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) dataset, ensuring model robustness.

## üóÇÔ∏è **Data Sources**

The core dataset for training and analysis is sourced from:
- **Raw Amazon Fashion Reviews:** `McAuley-Lab/Amazon-Reviews-2023` (config: `raw_review_Amazon_Fashion`)
- **Raw Amazon Fashion Metadata:** `McAuley-Lab/Amazon-Reviews-2023` (config: `raw_meta_Amazon_Fashion`)

---

## üìä **Evaluation & Metrics**

Model performance is rigorously assessed across both generation and classification tasks to ensure high quality and reliability.

- **Generation Quality:** Measured with **ROUGE-L, BLEU, BERTScore**, and **JSON Schema Adherence Rate**.
- **Classification Accuracy:** Measured with **F1-Score, Precision, Recall, and ROC AUC** for each classification head.
- **Performance:** Includes **inference latency** and **GPU memory usage** benchmarks for the quantized model to ensure deployment feasibility.
- **Qualitative Analysis:** A side-by-side comparison against the base Gemma-3 model to demonstrate the significant improvements from fine-tuning.
